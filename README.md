# Make commands

PHP Artisan make commands for our DDD starter template of the Laravel template.
Because we broke the default structure of the laravel structure to a more DDD approach.

We provide this package to make the default make commands compatible. 

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```
composer require engine45/artisan-maker-commands
```

The package will automatically register itself. 

You can optionally publish the config file with: 

```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="maker-commands-config"
```
